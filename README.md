## Publishing to npmjs

This package is named `@gmana/utils` on npm. To publish it, follow these steps:

1. **Login to npm (if not already authenticated):**

   ```sh
   npm login
   ```

   Make sure you have access to the `@gmana` scope or organization on npm.

2. **Build the package:**

   ```sh
   npm run build:all
   ```

   This will generate the production build and type declarations in the `dist/` folder.

3. **Check the package contents:**
   Ensure that only the intended files (e.g., `dist/`, `README.md`) are included, as specified in the `files` field of `package.json`.

4. **Publish to npm:**

   ```sh
   npm publish --access public
   ```

   The `--access public` flag is required for scoped packages like `@gmana/utils`.

5. **Verify:**
   After publishing, check https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gmana/utils to confirm the new version is available.

**Note:**

- Update the version in `package.json` before publishing a new release.
- You must have permission to publish to the `@gmana` scope on npm.

## Detailed Publishing Example

### 1. Update the Version

Before publishing, update the version in `package.json` according to [semver](https://semver.org/):

```json
{
  "version": "1.2.0"
}
```

You can use npm to bump the version automatically:

```sh
npm version patch   # or minor, major
```

### 2. Login to npm (if not already authenticated)

If you haven't logged in before, or your session expired:

```sh
npm login
```

- Enter your npm username, password, and email.
- If your account has 2FA enabled, enter the OTP code.
- Make sure your user has permission to publish to the `@gmana` scope.

### 3. Build the Package

Run the build script to generate the output in `dist/`:

```sh
npm run build:all
```

### 4. Check the Package Contents

Preview what will be published:

```sh
npm pack --dry-run
```

This shows the files that will be included, based on the `files` field in `package.json`.

### 5. Publish to npm

Publish the package with the correct access:

```sh
npm publish --access public
```

- The `--access public` flag is required for scoped packages (like `@gmana/utils`).
- If you see a permissions error, check your npm organization membership and scope access.

#### Example publish output:

```
$ npm publish --access public
npm notice
npm notice ðŸ“¦  @gmana/utils@1.2.0
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
dist/index.js
README.md
...
npm notice === Tarball Details ===
...
npm notice Published to: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gmana/utils
```

### 6. Verify the Release

Go to https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gmana/utils and check that your new version is listed.

### Troubleshooting

- **2FA issues:** If you have 2FA enabled, you may need to provide a one-time password (OTP) during publish.
- **Permission denied:** Make sure you are a member of the `@gmana` organization and have publish rights.
- **Scoped package errors:** Always use `--access public` for first-time publish of a scoped package.
- **Forgot to build:** If you publish without building, the `dist/` folder may be missing. Always run `npm run build:all` first.
